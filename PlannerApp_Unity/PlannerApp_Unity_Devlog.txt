12/19/2023 - The project has been created in unity, I have drafted up plans for how to port my existing java version over.
12/20/2023 - I am going to get started on a basic GUI for the app based on the plans I drew yesterday. **Change of plans, the way I want the view to work needs a model in order to work properly, for now i'll make a prefab for the task panels and go from there.
12/21/2023 - Working on the model today, completed some basic building blocks of the view. My current vision for the model involves an empty game object called the model manager which contains all the model scripts, they should be relatively easy to implement from the java version. I anticipate the largest hurdle to be me not knowing how to code in C# anymore. 
12/24/2023 - I didn't update this log but in a few days but I did make some progress on the app. Currently the app has a somewhat functional UI. The UI needs responsiveness added in. The save task button needs functionality added in. The add task button needs functionality added in, The UI needs the ability to scroll added in when the Tasks get larger than the screens size. I'm going to add these tasks to my skedpal, break them down into smaller steps, and pick one to get done today. **I have added in add task functionality, I will work on creating functionality for saving the task tomorrow.
12/25/2023 - Merry Christmas! Today i'll be working on the functionality for saving tasks, I should be able to use the same method that I made yesterday and then just adding in a few lines of code. **Save task functionality was added in successfully, I will be working on scrolling next, which is gonna take some time due to all the other functionality that scrolling depends on.
12/26/2023 Happy Birthday Andrea and Andre! Last night I finally figured out how to make the UI dynamic in Unity. Today i'll be fixing the rest of the font sizes in the program and then i'll be working on the scrolling functionality. **Font sizes are good enough for now moving on to scrolling functionality. **Gonna end work for now by getting some initial setup done for user input.
12/31/2023 - Happy Birthday Atlas! Today i'm working on the swiping functionality. I will be focusing on just receiving the touch data and write the code for converting that data into a direction for swiping at a later time.
01/01/2024 - Happy New Years! Today i'll be working on implementing touch management through a class called touch manager. I learned this technique from a youtuber called samyam. I'll be focused on establishing the barebones of the class.
01/02/2024 - Today i'll be working on the formula to calculate where to move the screen. **I'm having trouble with setting a maximum scroll height so i'll need to rework that formula. **Got that solved. Scrolling works like a charm, the bug where tasks have a much wider gap when the app first runs is gonna need to be solved for scrolling to work perfectly. I think with that I just need error handling and bug fixes to finish the app. I'll also need to find out how to make the phones keyboard appear when the app is built to a phone.
01/03/2024 - Tried to build the app to my phone, i'll need to fix an issue with the sdks, apparently unity cant build with the most recent sdks. 
01/05/2024 - I am deleting android sdk's beyond 32, that should allow me to build the planner app to my phone, From there I will need to test that everything works and then I'll need to make a list of all the errors in the app.
01/06/2024 - I have the SDKs deleted. I'll try building the app to my phone.
01/18/2024 - Deleting the SDKs did not work, looking into more solutions. **I'm looking at two potential solutions, the error message when the gradle build fails states that SDK 33 licenses have not been accepted, so I am reinstalling the SDK from android studio. The other solution is simply updating to the latest LTS unity editor. I'll try again and throw in an update when either of those finishes installing. **Tried again after reinstalling Android SDK 33 and got the exact same error. I'll look deeper into why that is happening. **I tried messing with with SDK files, apparently unity uses SDK files from a separate location from android studio so that is most likely the main cause of the problem. For now I will wait for the new install to finish and try that.
01/21/2024 - I have adjusted my plan. I will export the project to android studio and build it from there. This version of planner app is done, bugs and all.
